Introduction</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">This book is designed to give
all the essential information to get you programming in Python. The
book starts by running through the basics of the language before
showing you how to use some of the powerful libraries included in
Python, finally it will show you how to produce full applications
with form based user interfaces.</p>
<h1 lang="en-GB" class="western1"><a id="What_is_Python"></a>2.
What is Python</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python is an easy to learn
programming language which particularly popular with the hobbyist
it is also used by professional programs to write utilities. Python
is an interpreted language which makes it a good choice for rapid
application development.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python has a clear defined
syntax, a small set of keywords and a simple program structure,
this allows the programmer to quickly learn how to program in
Python. The simple syntax means that it is also easy to read which
has the advantage that source code is easy to maintain.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python has a large standard
library this means that scripts can be used across multiple
platforms without having compatibility issues. There are also a
vast number of freely available libraries which allow you to use
Python for virtually anything. Low level modules can easily be
added to the Python interpreter by writing these modules in an
compiled language such as C these modules run much faster. Finally
GUIs can be generated in Python which can then be ported to many
other operating systems.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python also has support for
objected orientated, structured and functional programming. It can
be complied as byte code for larger programs or run as an
interpreted language. It has high level dynamic data types and
supports dynamic type checking. Memory management is taken care of
automatically by Python.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python is available on a wide
variety of platforms including</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Unix (Solaris, Linux,
FreeBSD, AIX, HP/UX, SunOS, IRIX)</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Win 9x/ NT /2000 / XP /
Vista /Windows 7</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Macintosh</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">OS/2</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">DOS</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">PalmOS</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Windows CE</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Acorn/RISB OS</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">BeOS</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Amiga</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Java virtual
machine</p>

machine</p>

Getting Python</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The best place to download a
copy of Python is from the official web site which is
http://www.Python.org. This is also a good source of documentation,
news, current source code etc. This is probably the best place to
get further information on keywords and libraries.</p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Install Python</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">If the binary for your platform
is available then you can download it, if there is not a version
for your platform then you can download the source code and compile
it manually.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">If you have downloaded the
binary then it can simply be installed using the installer.</p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Setting Up the Path</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">To make life easier when working
with Python it is worth setting up the path variable for your
platform, the path variables tells the computer where to look for
executable files in this case the Python interpreter.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Note the path in the following
examples may vary so you might have to check where your copy of
Python was installed.</p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Unix / Linux Path</h2>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Csh shell</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">setenv PATH
“$PATH:/usr/local/bin/Python”</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Bash shell (Linux)</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">Export PATH=
“$PATH:/usr/local/bin/Python”</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">sh or ksh shell</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">PATH=“$PATH:/usr/local/bin/Python”</span></p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Windows Path</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">In the command prompt type</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">path
%path%;C:\Python</span></p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Running Python</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python can be run interactively
from the interpreter, from the command line using a script or from
an IDE.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">To run the interpreter from the
start menu open a command window then type</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">python</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The Python interpreter should
run and something similar to the following should be displayed on
the screen, if it doesn't then check your path variable is
correctly pointing to where Python was installed.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">Python 3.2.3 (default,
Apr 11 2012, 07:15:24) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on
win32</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">Type”help”,
“copyright”, “credits” or licence for more information</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">To run a Python script directly
type <b class="calibre2">python</b> followed by the program name</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">python
helloworld.py</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The command input above will
cause a Python script called <b class="calibre2">helloworld.py</b> to be run.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">There are numerous Integrated
Development Environments available for Python (IDLE, PythonWin,
PyCharm) these allow program creation and allow you to run the
Python programs directly as you develop them, although any text
editor can also be used to create programs using an IDE will speed
up developing scripts.</p>

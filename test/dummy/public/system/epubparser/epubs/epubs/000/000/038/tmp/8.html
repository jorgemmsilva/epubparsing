Python Syntax</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The syntax defines how scripts
should be written so that the interpreter can understand the code
you are writing. Incorrect syntax will cause your script to produce
errors and will slow the development time so take some time to
understand the syntax before starting to code. The coding standard
that most people write to is known as PEP8 this isn't as onerous as
it sounds and all the examples in the book are written to conform
to the standard. There are various online tools that allow you to
check you code some IDEs such as PyCharm will inspect and report on
code that does not follow the PEP8 specification.</p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Identifiers in Python</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">A Python identifier is a name
used to define a variable, function or other object. In Python
identifiers must start with an upper / lower case letter or an
underscore (_), the rest of the identifier can contain upper /
lower case letters, under scores or numeric characters. Python is a
case sensitive language so the identifiers ResultValue and
resultvalue will be interpreted as being different.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">There are some conventions which
are followed by Python programmers.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Class names start with
upper case letters all other identifiers should start with a lower
case letter.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Private identifiers
start with a leading underscore.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Strongly private
identifiers start with two leading underscores.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Language defined
special names end in two trailing underscores.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Reserved words (see
Appendix 2) may not be used as identifier names.</p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Program Layout</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">One of the main differences
between Python and other programming languages is there are no
braces to indicate functions, blocks of code or class definitions.
Line indentation is used to define these blocks instead. The
indentation can use spaces or tabs, the number of spaces or tabs
that are used for the indentation can be variable but all
statements in the block must be indented by the same amount, in the
following code the line <b class="calibre2">print (“Value still False”)</b> will
create an error as it is indented by an extra space.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">if True:</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">print ('Value is
True')</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">print ('Value still
True')</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">else:</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">print ('Value is
False')</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">print ('Value still
False')</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">In Python a line of code ends
with a new line, if you want to split a line of code across several
lines then the a back slash (\) can be used as a line continuation
character.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">Value = Var1 +
\</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">1000 * \</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">Var3</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Definitions which are enclosed
with [], {} or () can be split across lines without the
continuation character.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">Staff = [“John”,
“Simon”, “Tan”</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c7">“<span class="c8">Alan”,
“Dave”]</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">String literals can be enclosed
in single('), double(“) or triple quotes ('”, “”), the triple
quotes allow the string to span multiple lines.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">String1 =
'Test'</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">String2 = “Test
String”</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">String3 = “'Split
string across</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">multiple
lines”'</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Multiple statements can be
entered onto the same line as long as there is no requirement for a
new code block.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">X = 20:
print(X)</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Blocks of code made up from
individual statements are called suites. If a statement is compound
or complex (if, while, def, class) then it is terminated by a colon
followed by a suite. The following shows the basic syntax of the
while statement.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">while
expression:</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">suite</span></p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4">Comments</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Comments are indicated with a #
outside of a string literal, anything after a #will be ignored
until a new line is detected.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6"># This is a
comment</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">print ('Comment Test')
#This is a comment after a statement</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Multi line comment's are simply
formed by using multiple hashes</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6"># This multi line
comment could</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6"># be a
description</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6"># of a block of your
code</span></p>

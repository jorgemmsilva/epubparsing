Tkinter- GUI</h1>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4" id="subchapter108">Overview</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">In the modern world people
aren't used to using the command line for interacting with programs
they are used to using GUIs, with Python there are several options
for creating GUIs.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Tkinter is installed as part of
Python and so is a good option to use as there is no need to
download extra libraries. The other popular options to create GUIs
with Python are wxPython which is an open source library for
wxWindows and Jpython which gives Python scripts access to Java
class libraries.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">This book can't give full
details of how to use Tkinter so the aim is to give enough details
to allow the development of simple single form applications.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The examples will consist of a
window which is an area on the screen with a standard frame around
it, on to the window widgets will be added. Widgets are the common
controls that you are familiar with such as buttons, text entry,
radio buttons etc. To enable the widgets to be placed in positions
on the screen Tkinter uses a frame widget which can contain other
widgets.</p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Widget Layout</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">There are three layout managers
that can be used when creating an application these are pack, place
and grid. These layout managers allow you to arrange the widgets on
the screen.</p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Pack Manager</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">This is the simplest and allows
the widgets placement to be defined in relative terms rather than
accurately placing the widgets at set positions. It is the simplest
to use but due to its limited configuration options is generally
used only for simple applications.</p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Place Manager</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The place manager allows
accurate placement of widgets within a window by specifying the
co-ordinate of each item explicitly.</p>
<h3 lang="en-GB" class="western5">Grid Manager</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Grid gives the user greater
control than pack and is simpler to use than place so tends to be
the preferred option in most cases. It arranges the widgets into a
table and allows each widget to be placed in a particular cell,
widgets can also be specified to span more than one column and
align themselves differently within the grid.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The main advantage with the grid
manager is that you do not have to supply any coordinate
information, the rows and columns get automatically sized depending
on the size of the widgets they contain. So if a widget is changed
or updated the form will adjust the layout automatically.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Since Grid Manager is the most
popular and flexible the examples in this book will be written
using this method.</p>

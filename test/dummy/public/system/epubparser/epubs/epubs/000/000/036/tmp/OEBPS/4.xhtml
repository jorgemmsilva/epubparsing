thirty–three years old. It took me about a year to write it, in the
evenings after a day spent on other work, and it was written twice
through from start to finish. I was evidently still obsessed with police
action as a source of drama, but with the growth of experience in
writing, the character studies and the love story appear to have
smothered the plot a bit, and these aspects of the book now seem to me
to be the best.</p><p>The first chapter was quite frankly an experiment, and one which pleases
me still. It was a dangerous experiment, however, for a young writer to
make in the first pages of a book, for it defeated a good many readers
who might have enjoyed the story if they had been able to read on. In
spite of this the book did moderately well in this country and in
America. In 1936 a film was made from it at the Ealing Studios, starring
Clive Brook and Victoria Hopper.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Nevil Shute</p></blockquote></div></section><footer/></body></html>

Databases</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Databases are used for all sorts
of things, the ability to connect with a database and write code to
manipulate the data or extract data from the database is extremely
powerful.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">While Python can connect to most
databases this often requires additional libraries to be installed
to allow connection, once connected however the database will often
be accessed with SQL commands. SQL this is a standard language used
by most databases and allows for construction, adding, deleting
records and querying of databases.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python comes with SQLite so this
will be used in this chapter to demonstrate how to access a
database. This is a light weight database and is probably better
suited to development rather than to implementing a large scale
database where a more powerful database such as MySQL should be
considered.</p>
<h2 lang="en-GB" class="western4" id="subchapter105">SQL</h2>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">This book is about Python not
SQL but since the you will need an overview of some of the commands
to understand the Python code. SQL stands for structured query
language and is used by most databases.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">A database is built up of tables
containing records (rows), each record consists of a set of fields
(columns) containing the database information.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">So a simple table for an album
collection might contain the following fields key, band, album and
price so the data could be.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">0, Dio, Last in Line, 5.65</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">1, Faith No More, Angel Dust,
6.65</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">2, Marillion, Fugazi, 7.65</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Note the first row contains a
key this is a unique identify for the row (record), although not
necessarily required it is good practice to have a key field, no
two records should have the same key by following this rule it
means that each record is unique in some way.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">A table is created using the
CREATE TABLE command, for the above table the required SQL would
be</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="c5"><span class="c6">CREATE TABLE Albums(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, band TEXT, album TEXT, price
REAL)</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The command is fairly self
explanatory it creates a table with 4 fields. The first field is
called id and contains integer data and is the primary key for the
table this means that the information entered into this field needs
to be unique or it will be rejected. The next two fields are text
fields and the final field is a real number (float).</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">SQLite supports the following
data types, INTEGER, stored in 1 to 8 bytes dependant on the value,
REAL 8 byte IEEE float, TEXT and BLOB which can be used for storing
binary data.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Once the table is defined rows
can be added into the table this is done with the insert
command.

Introduction</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">This book is designed to give
all the essential information to get you programming in Python. The
book starts by running through the basics of the language before
showing you how to use some of the powerful libraries included in
Python, finally it will show you how to produce full applications
with form based user interfaces.</p>

What is Python</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python is an easy to learn
programming language which particularly popular with the hobbyist
it is also used by professional programs to write utilities. Python
is an interpreted language which makes it a good choice for rapid
application development.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python has a clear defined
syntax, a small set of keywords and a simple program structure,
this allows the programmer to quickly learn how to program in
Python. The simple syntax means that it is also easy to read which
has the advantage that source code is easy to maintain.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python has a large standard
library this means that scripts can be used across multiple
platforms without having compatibility issues. There are also a
vast number of freely available libraries which allow you to use
Python for virtually anything. Low level modules can easily be
added to the Python interpreter by writing these modules in an
compiled language such as C these modules run much faster. Finally
GUIs can be generated in Python which can then be ported to many
other operating systems.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python also has support for
objected orientated, structured and functional programming. It can
be complied as byte code for larger programs or run as an
interpreted language. It has high level dynamic data types and
supports dynamic type checking. Memory management is taken care of
automatically by Python.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Python is available on a wide
variety of platforms including</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Unix (Solaris, Linux,
FreeBSD, AIX, HP/UX, SunOS, IRIX)</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Win 9x/ NT /2000 / XP /
Vista /Windows 7</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="list-indent-western">Macintosh</p>

Getting Python</h1>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The best place to download a
copy of Python is from the official web site which is
http://www.Python.org. This is also a good source of documentation,
news, current source code etc. This is probably the best place
